# üë®‚Äçüíª How to get 2A2S running
1. Make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version [3.10.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3107/) is compatible)
2. Open cloned repo in the terminal.
3. Install all dependencies from [requirements.txt](https://github.com/NaufalGhifari/2A2S-Final-Project/blob/main/documentations/requirements.txt) with ```pip install -r /documentations/requirements.txt```.
4. Run the application with ```python main.py```
5. You are using 2A2S!
